# React Babel Webpack Boilerplate

This is an as simple as possible ES6/Webpack boilerplate for getting up and running with React. The purpose of this is for quickly prototyping with all the goodness of the NPM system at your disposal.

## Setup Guide

`git clone git@github.com:jarsbe/react-babel-webpack-boilerplate.git app`

`cd app`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Webpack is now watching your project for changes and a Python server is running.

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and you should be good to go!
